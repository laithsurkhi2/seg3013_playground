# seg3103_playground


## Synopsis

This is lab 1 for SEG 3103 done by Laith Al-Surkhi. In this lab we will help me get a better understanding about testing and start by testing out some things given to me.


## Code Example
In the assets folder there is all the screenshots of the codes. 

In the newmath_java: There is a division function that asks for numerator and denominator to do the division. It also includes Junit testing.

In the newmath_ex: It also contains a division function but in elixir which also asks for the numerator and denominator with the output. There is also exunit testing that shows, doctest, tests and failures.

In the newmath_ py: It also contains a division function which gives us a place ot input numerator and denominator. There is also py unit testing that shows us how many tests were ran.
